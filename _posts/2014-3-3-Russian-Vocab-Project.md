The number of words and phrases in a given language is overwhelming; it is impressive that a non-native speaker can become fluent in a foreign language at all.

Conventional wisdom tells us that a learner only reaches such a level of mastery through years of immersion -- living, speaking and breathing the language every day -- that allow them to internalise not only the sheer multitude of words, but also the mass of idioms, collocations and subtle meanings that collectively give them an “intuitive” knowledge of that language.

Taking a look at this enormous learning task -- the absorption of thousands of words and phrases in a foreign language -- I thought that there must be a way for students to learn more quickly, more comprehensively, and with more enjoyment in the daily learning exercise. Since any small improvements in the efficiency of the learning process would scale up thousands of times, I knew that investing time to optimise the system would pay dividends in days and weeks of saved studying time.

So I wrote a program intended to serve as this optimal tool, automating as much of the learning process as possible.

# Learn in descending order of frequency:
The first and simplest strategy to optimise study time is to focus on high-frequency words.
Commonly, language learners are taught to write down and learn the words and phrases that they personally encounter when they read or listen to content in their target language.
The issue with this approach is two-fold:
* First, manually copying down words soaks up studying time which could be better spent actually learning new material.
* Secondly, learning words in random order doesn’t take advantage of the huge law of diminishing returns when it comes to the frequency of words -- to the extent that learning a few high-frequency words can be just as useful as learning hundreds of low-frequency ones, sheerly because the former are far more likely to appear in speech and writing.

## Start with a frequency list
The simple solution to this is to learn in descending frequency order according to a frequency list of the whole language. These lists are calculated based on a huge corpus (body of texts) in the language. In my case, I used the one from the Russian National Corpus. Similar lists can be found online for any major language.

## Start with a corpus
However, a frequency list alone doesn’t give us enough data to make more detailed insights about word and phrase frequency. So instead, for my project I also needed a huge parallel corpus (a database of translated sentence pairs) that can be queried to find more granular data on individual word meanings and collocations (whose necessity will become clear further down this article).

# Learn multiple meanings:
The second principle of the system is to learn not individual words, but rather individual word meanings. This aims to account for the inherent semantic ambiguity of natural languages; the same word can have multiple different meanings, and that the correct meaning can only be determined from context. Take, for example, the multiple meanings of the English word squash:
* As a verb:
  * She squashed the sandwich
  * I squashed into the middle of the crowd
  * The defeat squashed her high spirits
* As a noun:
  * Orange squash
  * The squash club
  
From this, we see the necessity to learn multiple meanings, so that, for example, when a learner of English encounters 'squash' in a sentence, they understand the intended sense of the word in its context.
To make this learning more precise and effective, my program calculates the frequency of each meaning of a given word, and labels the flashcard testing each meaning by its frequency. In this way, that flashcard can be ranked in the deck exactly according to its frequency. This accounts for the fact that some meanings of a word are significantly more common — and therefore more useful to learn — than others.

# Learn collocations as well as individual words:
The third and final key tactic that I incorporated to boost the efficacy of vocab learning is to identify and learn idioms and collocations:
All languages are more than just thousands of individual words, but rather, a huge set of common patterns. These patterns — or collocations — exist everywhere in natural language, because they are easy both to produce and to understand. The importance of collocational knowledge in language learning could be an entire blog post of its own, but the essence of it is that you will never sound fluent in a language unless you learn collocations. Think: “to do progress” versus “to make progress”, “in total daylight” versus “in broad daylight”, “to stimulate someone’s interest” versus “to pique someone’s interest”. These are the kinds of patterns that an advanced learner needs to know, without which they will forever sound markedly ‘foreign’.
This applies as much to strong collocations — discrete, fixed idioms such as  "beat around the bush" — as it does to weaker ones, such as "heavy rain”, "unsung hero" and "funnily enough". 
It is very difficult to know collocations without explicitly and deliberately learning them, because they are formed on the basis not of logical, predictable rules, but rather of repeated habits.
